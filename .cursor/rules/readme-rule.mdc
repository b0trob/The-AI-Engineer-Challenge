### README.md Rules

- When you create README.md's - they should as clear as possible, and use technical but approachable language.
- Always add a step by step on how to deploy stuff
- DO NOT add emojis, stay professional but do not act like a general from the army.
- Always add a section for troubleshooting using easy-access tools such as curl, wget, etc.
- They should remain technically accurate, so always add references (links) to external resources such as official documentation.
